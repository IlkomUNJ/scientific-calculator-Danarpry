With all due respect sir, i will state that i was using a full scale ZIP to push because there is some slight change in gradle app in order for API Math to work. Im using AI to help me made some improvement including asking about the language. I mainly did this research myself. I do my deeds as my Religion told me to with helping the others make the API call and the function. But i get help by the others too, especially when it comes to design and code formatting. But i can say that i do this work on myself respectfully.
